Logging
  Don't send back full doc, it has hashed password

Error handling
  what kind of errors should be passed back to front end?
     db errors?
     bcrypt errors?

  what kind of errors should be logged internally?

    example:
      sending an empty password to bcrypt > it complains about not having a hash
  Specific: Error message was not being populated on the res even though it
   wasn't empty in the router.post('authenticate') message
    > it was because i was trying to do JSON.prettify when it wasn't a JSON obj

DB
   insureIndex
      check all indexes are created before preceding
      confirm data integrity? non-unique values check?
        if unique attribute was added later?
