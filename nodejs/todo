Error handling
  what kind of errors should be passed back to front end?
     db errors?
     bcrypt errors?

  what kind of erros shold be logged internally?

    example:
      sending an empy password to bcrypt > it complains about not having a hash
  Specific: Error message was not being populated on the res even though it

   wasn't empy in the router.post('authenticate') message

DB
   insureIndex
      check all indexes are created before preceeding
      confirm data integrity? non-unique values check?
        if unique attribute was added later?
