//FARI
App crashes if body has incorrect JSON //DONE

Loging
  Don't send back full doc, it has hashed password

Error handling
  what kind of errors should be passed back to front end?
     db errors?
     bcrypt errors?

  what kind of errors should be logged internally?

    example:
      sending an empty password to bcrypt > it complains about not having a hash
  Specific: Error message was not being populated on the res even though it
   wasn't empty in the router.post('authenticate') message
    > it was because i was trying to do JSON.prettify when it wasn't a JSON obj

DB
   insureIndex
    check all indexes are created before preceding
    confirm data integrity? non-unique values check?
      if unique attribute was added later?
  reconnect database (if fails on startup)
  put server down if database is down
